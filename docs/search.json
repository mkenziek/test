The solid line plots predicted values from a regression of violence on the vote spread, estimated separately on either side of the PAN win-loss threshold. Across this large time frame, PAN victories had a substantive effect on the average post-election homicide rate, increasing the rate by approximately 2% following a close PAN victory, increasing from 14% to 16%, as compared to a close PAN loss. Figure 1 supports my hypothesis that municipalities with a PAN candidate victory in local elections will experience a higher post-election municipal homicide rate per 100,000 people compared to municipalities where PAN candidates lost.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.

Breaking the regression discontinuity down by president reveals interesting trends. Figure 2 shows that while a PAN candidate was president, either when Vicente Fox or Felipe Calderón was in office from 2000-2012, PAN victories at the municipal level had a positive effect on the average post-election homicide rate, increasing the rate by approximately 2% following a close PAN victory, as compared to a close PAN loss. This finding also supports my hypothesis showing that a PAN victory at the municipal level under a PAN president increased violence as a result of crackdown on drug cartels. Figure 2 also shows that under president Nieto, a PRI candidate, the post-election homicide rate increased by approximately 5% in municipalities with close PAN victories.

H1 Regression Table.\nTable 2 presents estimates of the effect of PAN (National Action Party) winning close municipal elections on the post-election homicide rate per 100,000 people. The table shows the H1 model overall as well as the H1 model subsetted by president. In all models, the municipal population is controlled for. In Table 2, the overall Local Average Treatment effect (LATE), controlling for municipal population, is 1.875. This means that from 2001-2020 a PAN mayoral win causes an almost 2-point increase in the post-election homicide rate at the municipal level. Substantively, this a significant effect. For example, a municipality with a population of 643,447 people that experienced a 2% homicide rate increase would correspond to approximately 12.87 more homicides on average. However, this 2 point bump is not statistically significant (p &gt; 0.05).\nThe magnitude of the LATE changes when the model is run independently for each presidential administration. During the PAN Fox administration (2000-2006), the LATE increases to 2.897. During the PAN Calderón administration (2006-2012), the LATE decreases to 0.914. Given that the Calderón administration is the administration that officially began the war on drugs, the decrease in the LATE from the Fox to Calderón administration shows that under Calderón the effect of a PAN municipal win caused a smaller increase in the post-election homicide rate than under Fox. However, these coefficients are statistically insignificant. During the PRI party Nieto administration (2012-2018), the LATE increases to 6.514. This is the only coefficient in Table 2 that reaches conventional levels of statistical significance (p &gt; 0.05). Interpreted in a real-world context, this coefficient means that the effect of a PAN municipal win caused a larger increase in the post-election homicide rate than under a PRI president. This shows that when the presidential administration and local government are unaligned, given that PAN and PRI are opposing parties, PAN mayors may be less effective at imposing a crackdown on criminal violence at the municipal level. Under the MORENA party Obrador (2018-Present), the LATE for PAN wins drastically decreases to -24.841. This coefficient is an extremely large, but not statistically significant, and should be interpreted with caution. The decrease in the LATE under President Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s administration could be attributed to President Obrador’s shift towards civilian-led policing however more research would be needed. The lack of statistical significance for most coefficients, including the large effect under Obrador, could be influenced by sample size. Notably, the sample size for the Obrador administration is very small, 375 observations, which may reduce the statistical power of the hypothesis test. A smaller sample size can lead to wider confidence intervals and decreased sensitivity to detect true effects, making it more challenging to achieve statistical significance.\n\n\n \n\n  \n    \n    \n    tinytable_uv7x289pa5ydawrnqsrp\n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n        \n              \n                 \n                Bivariate\n              \n        \n        \n        \n                \n                  (Intercept)            \n                  12.934*** (0.274)\n                \n                \n                  Party Alternation Index\n                  0.668*** (0.119) \n                \n                \n                  Municipal Population   \n                  0.000 (0.000)    \n                \n                \n                  Num.Obs.               \n                  12364            \n                \n                \n                  R2 Adj.                \n                  0.002            \n                \n        \n      \n    \n\n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n\nTable 3.

    "text": "Turf wars for the control of drug trafficking corridors in Mexico have been associated with a lethal crisis of criminal violence in the country since the 1990s. After peaceful coexistence in the 1980s, six turf wars broke out between Mexico’s five major cartels (Tijuana, Juárez, Sinaloa, Gulf, and La Familia Michoacana) on the Pacific Coast between 1990 and 2006 (Trejo and Ley 2018). Annual turf war deaths reached 1,400 in 2006 (Trejo and Ley 2018). In 2006, the Felipe Calderón administration began the first large-scale deployment of federal troops against the drug cartels, marking the beginning of the “Mexican War on Drugs” (Espinosa and Rubin 2015). To implement large-scale efforts to combat drug trafficking, the Calderón administration worked with PAN mayors and municipal police. The crackdowns on drug cartels under Calderón ushered in a dramatic spiral of violence (Trejo and Ley 2018). Between 2007 and 2012, more than 70,000 people were murdered in intercartel conflicts (Trejo and Ley 2018). For political context, Calderón was Mexico’s second National Action Party (PAN) president, continuing PAN’s control of the office after Vicente Fox’s electoral victory for PAN in 2000. Fox’s election as president represented the first opposition candidate to win the presidency of Mexico in recent history, ending the Institutional Revolutionary Party’s (PRI) hegemonic, 71-year-long rule (Trejo and Ley 2018). The Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) has historically represented a center-right platform with a broad base of support, while the National Action Party (PAN) emerged as a conservative opposition advocating for free-market economics and social conservatism (Foreign Relations 2024). Afrter Calderón, President Enrique Peña Nieto (PRI) initiated reform efforts in 2012, which, although initially yielding decreases in homicides, ultimately fell short in tackling deep-rooted corruption and crime-related violence, culminating in a peak of 33,341 homicides in 2018 (Foreign Relations 2024). In response to widespread criticism of militarized approaches, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, a left-wing candidate of the MORENA party, upon assuming office in 2018, vowed to shift towards civilian-led policing; however, despite the implementation of initiatives like the creation of a new National Guard, violence levels have persistently remained high, amplifying the challenges in governance, security, and anti-cartel endeavors (Foreign Relations 2024).\nThis study delves into the relationship between the success of PAN candidates in Mexican municipal elections and the post-election municipal homicide rate per 100,000 people, while also considering the impact of party rotation in mayoral office and the stability of PAN mayoral governance. Inspired by the work of Trejo and Ley (2018), this research challenges the traditional understanding of a clear separation between government authorities and organized crime groups (OCGs), aiming to explore the ‘gray zone’ where these entities intersect through informal protection systems (Trejo and Ley 2018). Understanding how PAN governance and party alternation may disrupt state-criminal arrangements is essential for comprehending the broader dynamics of violence and governance in Mexico. Independent variables include the margin of victory for the PAN candidate, a municipal alternation index measuring party rotation, and a PAN power index assessing the stability of PAN mayoral terms. The dependent variable is the post-election municipal homicide rate per 100,000 people, encompassing all homicides, not solely those associated with intercartel conflicts.\nMayors play a crucial role in this context. They appoint municipal police chiefs and establish policies governing police conduct (Dell 2015). Consequently, PAN mayors could potentially bolster Calderón’s, and other PAN presidents’, anti-drug efforts by appointing law enforcement authorities amenable to cooperation and by encouraging information-sharing with the PAN federal government. Qualitative evidence suggests that under Calderón’s administration, PAN mayors were more inclined to seek law enforcement assistance from the PAN federal government compared to their non-PAN counterparts (Dell 2015). The propensity for PAN mayors to support Calderón’s war on drugs may stem from various factors, including enhanced cooperation among authorities from the same party, disparities in corruption levels, or ideological alignment (Dell 2015). Ultimately, mayors matter for homicide rates at the municipal level because PAN drug-war operations involving the intervention of federal police and military in cartel activity are most effective when local authorities are politically aligned with the federal government."

The solid line plots predicted values from a regression of violence on the vote spread, estimated separately on either side of the PAN win-loss threshold. Across this large time frame, PAN victories had a substantive effect on the average post-election homicide rate, increasing the rate by approximately 2% following a close PAN victory, increasing from 14% to 16%, as compared to a close PAN loss. Figure 1 supports my hypothesis that municipalities with a PAN candidate victory in local elections will experience a higher post-election municipal homicide rate per 100,000 people compared to municipalities where PAN candidates lost.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. This figure plots homicide rates against the PAN margin of victory for 2001-2020, with a negative margin indicating a PAN loss. Each point represents the average value of the outcome in vote spread bins of width one-half of a percent-age point. The solid line plots predicted values, with separate quadratic vote spread trends estimated on either side of the PAN win-loss threshold.\nFigure 2 examines post-election homicide rates against the PAN margin of victory across municipalities and presidencies, with a negative margin indicating a PAN loss. Each point represents average violence in 0.5 percentage point vote spread bins aggregated by president in office. The solid line plots predicted values from a regression of violence on the vote spread, estimated separately on either side of the PAN win-loss threshold. Breaking the regression discontinuity down by president reveals interesting trends. Figure 2 shows that while a PAN candidate was president, either when Vicente Fox or Felipe Calderón was in office from 2000-2012, PAN victories at the municipal level had a positive effect on the average post-election homicide rate, increasing the rate by approximately 2% following a close PAN victory, as compared to a close PAN loss. This finding also supports my hypothesis showing that a PAN victory at the municipal level under a PAN president increased violence as a result of crackdown on drug cartels. Figure 2 also shows that under president Nieto, a PRI candidate, the post-election homicide rate increased by approximately 5% in municipalities with close PAN victories. Lastly, Figure 2 shows that under president Obrador, a MORENA candidate, the post-election homicide rate decreased by approximately 20% in municipalities with close PAN victories.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.

H1 Regression Table.\nTable 2 presents estimates of the effect of PAN (National Action Party) winning close municipal elections on the post-election homicide rate per 100,000 people. The table shows the H1 model overall as well as the H1 model subsetted by president. In all models, the municipal population is controlled for. In Table 2, the overall Local Average Treatment effect (LATE), controlling for municipal population, is 1.875. This means that from 2001-2020 a PAN mayoral win causes an almost 2-point increase in the post-election homicide rate at the municipal level. Substantively, this a significant effect. For example, a municipality with a population of 643,447 people that experienced a 2% homicide rate increase would correspond to approximately 12.87 more homicides on average. However, this 2 point bump is not statistically significant (p &gt; 0.05).\nThe magnitude of the LATE changes when the model is run independently for each presidential administration. During the PAN Fox administration (2000-2006), the LATE increases to 2.897. During the PAN Calderón administration (2006-2012), the LATE decreases to 0.914. Given that the Calderón administration is the administration that officially began the war on drugs, the decrease in the LATE from the Fox to Calderón administration shows that under Calderón the effect of a PAN municipal win caused a smaller increase in the post-election homicide rate than under Fox. However, these coefficients are statistically insignificant. During the PRI party Nieto administration (2012-2018), the LATE increases to 6.514. This is the only coefficient in Table 2 that reaches conventional levels of statistical significance (p &gt; 0.05). Interpreted in a real-world context, this coefficient means that the effect of a PAN municipal win caused a larger increase in the post-election homicide rate than under a PRI president. This shows that when the presidential administration and local government are unaligned, given that PAN and PRI are opposing parties, PAN mayors may be less effective at imposing a crackdown on criminal violence at the municipal level. Under the MORENA party Obrador (2018-Present), the LATE for PAN wins drastically decreases to -24.841. This coefficient is an extremely large, but not statistically significant, and should be interpreted with caution. The decrease in the LATE under President Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s administration could be attributed to President Obrador’s shift towards civilian-led policing however more research would be needed. The lack of statistical significance for most coefficients, including the large effect under Obrador, could be influenced by sample size. Notably, the sample size for the Obrador administration is very small, 375 observations, which may reduce the statistical power of the hypothesis test. A smaller sample size can lead to wider confidence intervals and decreased sensitivity to detect true effects, making it more challenging to achieve statistical significance.\n\n\n \n\n  \n    \n    \n    tinytable_71whp6oh0t7y8xg3bvpz\n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n        \n              \n                 \n                Bivariate\n              \n        \n        \n        \n                \n                  (Intercept)            \n                  12.934*** (0.274)\n                \n                \n                  Party Alternation Index\n                  0.668*** (0.119) \n                \n                \n                  Municipal Population   \n                  0.000 (0.000)    \n                \n                \n                  Num.Obs.               \n                  12364            \n                \n                \n                  R2 Adj.                \n                  0.002            \n                \n        \n      \n    \n\n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n\nTable 3.

The coefficient for the alternation_index variable is also statistically significant at conventional levels (p &lt; 0.001) indicating that the observed relationship between alternation index and post-election homicide rate is unlikely to have occurred by chance.\n\n\n \n\n  \n    \n    \n    tinytable_s7t5b8kzm58x8m3zmmln\n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n        \n              \n                 \n                Bivariate\n              \n        \n        \n        \n                \n                  (Intercept)         \n                  14.084*** (0.196)\n                \n                \n                  PAN Power Index     \n                  0.009 (0.220)    \n                \n                \n                  Municipal Population\n                  0.000 (0.000)    \n                \n                \n                  Num.Obs.            \n                  12364            \n                \n                \n                  R2 Adj.             \n                  0.000            \n                \n        \n      \n    \n\n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n\nTable 4.

Substantively, the effect size is somewhat small, indicating that PAN power stability is somewhat associated with a small increase in the post-election homicide rate. The coefficient for the PAN Power Index variable is also not statistically significant at conventional levels."
